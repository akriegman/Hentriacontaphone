# Just Intonation Keyboard

This is a just intonation keyboard that can play any interval generated by perfect fifths and major thirds, within one octave. From a given key the perfect fifth is the key just to the right and the major third is the key above and to the right, give or take an octave. Thus the minor third is below and to the right.

Press keys on your computer keyboard to play the keys on the instrument.

In particular, try pressing three keys in a triangle to play a chord. Triangles pointing up are major chords and triangles pointing down are minor. A major scale is four keys in a row plus the three keys above. To travel around the circle of fifths move left or right, and to change keys by major thirds -- e.g. Giant Steps -- move up and down. Try making more complicated chords out of stacked thirds.

Most computer keyboards aren't able to play certain combinations of keys. If you can't play chords, try using the punctuation keys or try using a different keyboard.

I am borrowing the code from someone else's 31 tone equal temperment keyboard, which you can view [here](http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/rtavenner/Hentriacontaphone/master/index.html).
The placement of the F1, F2, ... keys is different on every keyboard, so this program works best with a chromebook keyboard.
