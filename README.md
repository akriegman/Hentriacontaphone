# Hentriacontaphone

This is a 31-tone keyboard.

Press keys on your keyboard to play the keys on the instrument.

I tried to make the instrument keys line up with the computer keys in an obvious way.
However, the placement of the F1, F2, ... keys is different on every keyboard.
This program works best with a chromebook keyboard.
