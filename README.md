# Just Intonation Keyboard

This is a just intonation keyboard that can play any interval generated 3 and 5, within one octave. From a given key the perfect fifth is the key just to the right and the major third is the key above and to the right, give or take an octave. Thus the minor third is below and to the right.

Press keys on your keyboard to play the keys on the instrument.
In particular, try pressing three keys in a triangle to play a chord. Triangles pointing up are major chords and triangles pointing down are minor.

Ignore the visuals, I am borrowing the code from someone else's 31 tone equal temperment keyboard. I don't know why they chose 31 tones, maybe they meant to do 41 since the 41 tone scale has the next best approximation of a perfect fifth after the 12 tone scale?
The placement of the F1, F2, ... keys is different on every keyboard, so this program works best with a chromebook keyboard.

You can view the 31 tone keyboard [here](http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/rtavenner/Hentriacontaphone/master/index.html). Maybe in the future I will host my keyboard.
